## Download or Get Files From Remote Server

```
pscp.exe -P 22 root@192.168.142.144:/root/*.gz .
```

## Upload or Put Files To Remote Server

```
pscp.exe -P 22 pass.txt config.sys root@192.168.142.144:/root/
```

## Download or Get Directories Recursively From Remote Server

If we want to get remote directories and download local we need to use recursive options which is -r.

```
pscp.exe -P 22 -r root@192.168.142.144:/root/binaries/ .
```

## Upload or Put Directories Recursively To Remote Server

We can also send or upload local directories to the remote server. We will again use the -r option.

```
pscp.exe -P 22 -r binaries ismail@192.168.142.144:/root/binaries/
```
