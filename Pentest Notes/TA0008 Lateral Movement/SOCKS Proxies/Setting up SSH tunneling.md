```
ssh -i id_rsa_persist -D 1088 -q -C -N root@10.10.110.100
```

What that command does: 

    -D 1088: open a SOCKS proxy on local port :1088. If that port is taken, try a different port number. If you want to open multiple SOCKS proxies to multiple endpoints, choose a different port for each one.
    -C: compress data in the tunnel, save bandwidth
    -q: quiet mode, don’t output anything locally
    -N: do not execute remote commands, useful for just forwarding ports
    user@ma.ttias.be: the remote SSH server you have access to

Once you run that, ssh will stay in the foreground until you CTRL+C it to cancel it. If you prefer to keep it running in the background, add -f to fork it to a background command:
